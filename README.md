# Wine classification with SVM

We use here the data from <a href="https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/wine">UC Irvine</a>.

1/ Quick visualization of the repartition of the target & the correlation heatmap

2/ Modelisation with random hyperparameters that are not good at all

3/ Research of bests hyperparameters to improve the model
